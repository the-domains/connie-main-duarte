**Connie Main Duarte** is currently one of the pastors at the [Meeting Point][0], a Baptist church in Estoril, Portugal. She is the Chair of [Mission-Net][1], a movement to promote a missional lifestyle amongst young people in Europe. She also coordinates an intensive discipleship programme for staff and young graduates at [GBU Portugal][2].

She also travels around Europe speaking at conferences and seminars. Connie loves teaching and preaching and longs to see more young people using their gifts both in missions and the local church. She has a passion for integrated mission and community living.

Connie studied both in the areas of missions and communication while living in Canada. In 1998, she moved to Portugal to work with university students. After ten years with GBU Portugal, Connie taught at the Baptist Theological Seminary before taking her current positions.

While Connie loves working with church, missions, preaching, and teaching, a bigger passion is her family: her husband Jo√£o, and their two boys, Joshua and Caleb.
